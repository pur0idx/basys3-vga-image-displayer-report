\section{Design Decision}

\subsection{{Module Architecture}} \\
The system is divided into three modules: \texttt{image\_generator}, \texttt{image\_pixel\_controller}, and \texttt{vga\_controller}. This modular approach improves clarity, debugging, and scalability. Each module has a defined role—generation, coordination, and display—allowing isolated testing and easier future upgrades.

\subsection{{Communication Protocols}} \\
We used native signal interfacing instead of protocols like AXI, as all modules share the same clock and communicate directly. This reduces latency and resource overhead, which suits our tightly-coupled design.


\subsection{{Clock and Data Rate}} \\
A shared clock domain was chosen to avoid synchronization issues. The VGA controller operates at 25\,MHz to match 640×480 @60Hz standards. Other modules operate within this timing without critical delays.

\subsection{{Resource Utilization}} \\
Using Single Port ROM for storing image data, but logic is efficiently distributed. The current design minimizes LUT and FF usage, focusing on simplicity.
